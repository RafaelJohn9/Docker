This is a repository that deals with docker the basics and some advanced stuff


Certainly! Docker is a powerful tool for containerization, and here are some practical exercises to help you get hands-on experience with Docker on a Linux system. Before starting, make sure Docker is installed on your machine.

- [x] *Exercise 1:* **Basic Container Operations**
Run a simple container:

Pull the latest Ubuntu image from Docker Hub.
Run a container from the Ubuntu image in interactive mode.
Inside the container, execute a command, e.g., ls, echo "Hello, Docker!", etc.
Exit the container.
List and manage containers:

List all running containers.
List all containers, including stopped ones.
Stop a running container.
Remove a container.
- [x] *Exercise 2:* **Docker Images**
Create a Dockerfile:

Create a directory for your Dockerfile.
Inside the directory, create a simple Dockerfile that installs a package of your choice.
Build an image from the Dockerfile.
Custom Image and Container:

Run a container from the image you created.
Install additional software or make changes inside the container.
Commit the changes to a new image.
Push the new image to Docker Hub (you'll need an account).
- [x] *Exercise 3*: **Docker Compose**
Compose Multi-Container Application:

Create a Docker Compose file for a simple web application with two services: a web server and a database (e.g., Nginx and MySQL).
Specify volumes and networks in the Compose file.
Run the entire application using Docker Compose.
Environment Variables in Compose:

Modify your Compose file to use environment variables for configuration.
Use a .env file to set values for the environment variables.
Re-run the Compose file, ensuring the application still works.
- [x] *Exercise 4*: Networking
Container Networking:

Create a custom bridge network.
Run two containers, each connected to the custom bridge network.
Ensure the containers can communicate with each other using their container names.
Expose Ports:

Run a container with a service that listens on a specific port.
Map the container port to a different port on the host machine.
Access the service from your host machine's web browser.
- [x] *Exercise 5*: **Docker Volumes**
	Persistent Data with Volumes:

Run a container with a volume mounted for persistent storage.
Write data to the volume from inside the container.
Stop and remove the container, then start a new container mounting the same volume.
Bind Mounts:

Use a bind mount to share a host machine directory with a container.
Modify files in the host directory and observe changes inside the container.


- [ ] *Advanced Task 1:* **Docker Swarm Deployment**
Objective:
Set up a Docker Swarm cluster and deploy a multi-service application.

Initialize Swarm:

Initialize a Docker Swarm on your machine.
Create Overlay Network:

Create an overlay network for communication between services.
Deploy Services:

Write a Docker Compose file that defines multiple services (e.g., web app, database, caching).
Deploy the services to the Swarm cluster using the docker stack deploy command.
Scale Services:

Scale one of the services to run multiple replicas.
Service Updates:

Update the version of one of the services and observe how Docker Swarm handles rolling updates.
Health Checks:

Implement health checks for at least one service in the Compose file.
Verify how Docker Swarm responds to failing health checks.

- [ ] *Advanced Task 2:* **Docker Security**
Objective:
Explore Docker security features and best practices.

Container Isolation:

Create a Docker container that runs an application with specific resource constraints (CPU, memory).
Explore and implement user and group settings to restrict container privileges.
Docker Content Trust:

Enable Docker Content Trust globally on your Docker daemon.
Push a signed image to Docker Hub and attempt to pull it on another machine. Verify that Docker Content Trust ensures image integrity.
AppArmor/SELinux:

Configure Docker to use AppArmor (on Ubuntu) or SELinux (on Red Hat-based systems).
Run a container with a custom AppArmor or SELinux profile and observe the security enhancements.
Secrets Management:

Use Docker secrets to manage sensitive information (e.g., database passwords).
Update a service to use secrets, and verify that the secret values are not exposed in the container environment.
Vulnerability Scanning:

Integrate a Docker image vulnerability scanning tool (e.g., Clair, Trivy).
Scan an image for vulnerabilities and take appropriate actions to address them.
